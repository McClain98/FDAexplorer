# Background

Each person who wants to market in the U.S., a Class I, II, and III device 
intended for human use, for which a Premarket Approval application
(PMA) is not required, must submit a 510(k) to FDA unless the device is
exempt from 510(k) requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act.

A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate 
that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, 
substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device 
(section 513(i)(1)(A) FD&C Act). Submitters must compare their 
device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and 
support their substantial equivalence claims. 

## What is Substantial Equivalence?

A 510(k) requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to another legally U.S. marketed device. Substantial equivalence means that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate.

A device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it:

- has the same intended use as the predicate; and
- has the same technological characteristics as the predicate;

or

- has the same intended use as the predicate; and
-has different technological characteristics and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness; and
- the information submitted to FDA demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as the legally marketed device.
